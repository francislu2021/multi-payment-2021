## _User story
<p>As more people around the world joined global eCommerce waves, having a multiple payment interface has been an increasing urgent for many of the small to medium merchants. 

As my work with one of the leading global eCommerce Saas platform, I witnessed the inconveniences of different global merchants who experience and constantly face challenges from daily operaitons with getting paid and make payments to any corner of the world. </p>

# Project objective
I wish to create an application that merchants can perform following functions:
<ol>
<li>receive payments from integrated banks, 3rd party payment gateways, e-transfer</li>
<li>deposit the received payments to integrated bank accounts, debit cards or 3rd party payment gateways.</li>
<li>Make payments to integrated banks, 3rd party payment gateways, e-transfer</li>
<li>shop different financial products - marketplace for financial products, such as etf, stocks, futures, bonds etc</li>

<p>I understand perfectly there is a long way to go before I can achieve. But with the learning of react.JS, node.JS etc. It enables us to build, delploy and scale at cloud and serve anyone. </p>

<p>For now, you can only sign up with both platform accont and an automatically assigned Stripe account. When you click sign up, you get redirected to Stripe payment page directly with the display of the chosen product and amount to pay.</p>


# Commercial objectives
Here, to better serve global merchants. 

# Scalability of the platform

When user sign up on our application, he/she will automatically get a stripe account for him so that the person can automatically set up the stripe account at once.
